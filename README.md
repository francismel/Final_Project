## About
I originally intended for this app to run a sentiment analysis on tweets with the help of the twitter API. But after 2 weeks of being ghosted by twitter, I decided analyzing Yelp.com reviews was the next best choice. After exceeding the number of allowed API calls to Yelp and subsequently being banned from the site, I moved onto IMDB!

I used 2 machine learning models to analyze reviews. Textblob- a pre-trained Python machine learning library, as well as the "Mel Model" - a quick and dirty neural network my brother 
and I cooked up for fun.

## Usage
Just copy and paste a link to an IMDB user reviews page and press submit.

example: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099785/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_3
